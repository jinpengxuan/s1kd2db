These XSL stylesheets convert S1000D data modules to DocBook.

They are a work in progress, primarily intended for use with other programs (such as pandoc) which can then convert DocBook XML to many other formats, but which do not support the S1000D schemas.

The stylesheets should not (by default) attempt to emulate S1000D presentation, but translate S1000D constructs to their simplest DocBook equivalents. Options may be added as parameters for more control.
